# Weather Info Fetcher

This mini-project is a great way for a junior developer to learn API interaction, database handling, and testing in Python.

## Project Overview

### Title
Weather Info Fetcher

### Objective
To build a Python application that retrieves weather information for a specified location from a public weather API, stores the data in a local database, and includes basic tests to ensure functionality.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Requests**: To make API calls.
- **SQLite**: For local database storage.
- **Pytest**: For writing and running tests.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Free API to fetch weather data.

## Steps

1. **Setup and API Key:**
    - Sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.
    - Install necessary Python packages: `requests`, `pytest`, `sqlite3` (usually included in Python standard library).

2. **Database Setup:**
    - Create a SQLite database with a table to store weather data.

3. **API Interaction:**
    - Write a function to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

4. **Database Interaction:**
    - Write functions to insert and retrieve data from the database.

5. **Testing:**
    - Write tests for API interaction and database functions using Pytest.

6. **Security Considerations:**
    - Securely store and use the API key.
    - Handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
